# Comprehensions and Functional Programming

## Comprehensions

**List**

> List comprehensions is a concise way to create a list in python

```python
L = list(range(1,11))
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# E = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
E = []
for e in L:
    e+=1
    E.append(e)
print(E)
```



```
new_list = [expression for e in iterable if condition]
```

## Lambda Functions

> A lambda function is a small **anonymous function** defined using the lambda keyword

**Important Points**

* It is called anonymous because it doesn't have name like a normal function

  ```python
  def add_five(n):
      return n+5
  ```

* Lambda functions allows u to write functions in a compact ways

```
lambda args : expression
```

## Functional Programming

> FP is a programming paradigm that involves organizing your code in functions

**Key Principles**

1. **Pure Functions** : PF are the functions for the given input output will always be same.

2. **Declarative Style** : Focuses on what needs to be done, rather than how to do it.

3. **First Class values / citizens and High Order Functions :** 

   1. Functions can be stored in a variable
   2. Functions can be passed to other functions
   3. Function can be returned from other f

   ```python
   i = 100
   
   def print_val(n):
       print(n)
       
   print_val(100)
   
   
   def print_val(n):
       return 100
   ```

    

### Imperative vs Declarative

```python
numbers = [1,2,3,4]
result = []
for number in numbers:
    result+= number ** 2
print(result) 
```
