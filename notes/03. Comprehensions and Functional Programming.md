# Comprehensions and Functional Programming

## Comprehensions

> Comprehensions allows us to create a new sequence in a short and concise way

**List Comprehensions**

> List comprehensions is a concise way to create a list in python

```python
L = list(range(1,11))
# [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# E = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
E = []
for e in L:
    e+=1
    E.append(e)
print(E)
```



```
new_list = [expression for e in iterable if condition]
```

## Lambda Functions / Ex

> A lambda function is a small **anonymous function** defined using the lambda keyword

**Important Points**

* It is called anonymous because it doesn't have name like a normal function

  ```python
  def add_five(n):
      return n+5
  ```

* Lambda functions allows u to write functions in a compact ways

```
lambda args : expression
```

## Functional Programming

> FP is a programming paradigm that involves organizing your code in functions

* **Declarative Style** : Focuses on what needs to be done, rather than how to do it.

**Key Principles**

1. **Pure Functions** : PF are the functions for the given input output will always be same.

2. **First Class values / citizens :** 

   1. Functions can be stored in a variable
   2. Functions can be passed to other functions (High Order Functions)
   3. Function can be returned from other function (High Order Functions)

   ```python
   i = 100
   
   def print_val(n):
       print(n)
       
   print_val(100)
   
   
   def print_val(n):
       return 100
   ```

    


### Imperative vs Declarative

```python
numbers = [1,2,3,4]
result = []
for number in numbers:
    result+= number ** 2
print(result) 
```

### High Order Function

> HOF is a function that takes a function as an argument , return a function as its output

> Closure is a function that remembers that values from the environment where it was created, ever after the environment is gone

## Builtin - High Order Function

| Function             | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| .map(func, iterable) | Apply a function to every item in an iterable |
|                      |                                               |
|                      |                                               |



## Summary

* Comprehensions : Concise way of creating a new iterable (list, tuple, set, dictionary)
* zip function
* Lambda Functions : anonymous functions
* Functional Programming
  * Functions can be stored in variable
  * Functions can be passed to other functions (High Order Fn)
  * Functions can be returned from another  (High Order Fn)

* Custom High Order Function
* Built-in High Order
  * map
  * filter
  * max, min
  * any, all
  * sorted
