# Object Oriented Programming

> Programming paradigm are different approaches or style of programming

1. Imperative Programming
2. Declarative Programming
3. Procedural Oriented Programming
4. Object Oriented Programming
5. FP
6. Event Driven Programming
7. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

## Class and Object

> Class and objects are fundamental concepts in OOP.

> Class is a user defined datatype that has its own data members and member functions

```python
class Student:
    pass
```

## Constructors

> Constructors are **special member functions** which are used to initialize **instance variables**.

```python
class A:
    # Define Constructor
    def __init__(self):
        print("Constructor Invoked")
        
# Object Creation        
obj = A()
```



## Variables

1. Instance Variables : Instance Variables are the variables which are unique for every object we create
2. Static Variables

## Methods

1. Instance Method
2. Static Method

## Summary

* Creting Class and Objects

* Constructors (_ _ init _ _)

* self

* Instance vs Static Variables

* Object Reference Variable

  ```
  obj1 = A()
  obj2 = obj1
  ```

* @staticmethod vs @classmethod
* Access Modifers
