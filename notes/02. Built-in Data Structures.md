# Inbuilt Data Structures

> In computer science a data structure is a way of organizing , storing and managing data to perform operations efficiently.

1. List
2. Tuple
3. Set
4. Dictionary

## List

> A list in Python is an **Ordered, Mutable collection** that can hold items of mixed data types

### Create List

```python
num = 23
print(type(num))

num = int(23)
print(type(num))

L = list([1,2,3,4])
L = [1,2,3,4,4]
```

### Accessing, Iterating and Searching Elements

```python
L = list(range(1,11))
print(L)
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print(L[4])
print(len(L))
```

## Tuple

> A tuple is immutable ordered sequence element





```
D = {"k1":"v1"}
D["k11"]

KeyError
D.get("k11","NotDefined")

"KeyNotDefined"

D.keys()
for k in D:
  print(k)
  
  
```
